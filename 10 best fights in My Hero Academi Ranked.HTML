      <br><br><br><br>
        <br><h2><span>10</span>/10.<br>Izuku Midoriya Vs Gentle Criminal</h2>
      <br><br>
      <img src="https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/My-Hero-Academia-Midoriya-Versus-Gentle-Criminal.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5">
      <br>.
      Izuku Midoriya clashed against Gentle Criminal during the U.A Cultural Festival arc of My <br> Hero Academia. As Gentle finally prepared to announce himself to the world, Midoriya <br> stood in his way and stopped him from accomplishing his goals.
      <br><br><br>
      Although Gentle was quite powerful, Midoriya showed off his growth by reading him like a <br> book and then unleashing the power of Air Force on him. To date, this fight remains to be one <bR> of the best seen in the series.
      <br><br><br><br>
      
      <br><h2><span>9</span>/10.<br>Mirio Togata Vs Overhaul.
      <br><br>
      <img src="https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Mirio-Cropped.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5">
      <br>
      Mirio Togata went firing on all cylinders during the raid on the Shie Hassaikai hideout in My <br> Hero Academia Season 4. His clash against Overhaul was expected and Horikoshi made sure <br> to deliver when it arrived.
      <br><br><br><br><br>
      
      <h2><span>8</span>/10.<br>Izuku Midoriya Vs Overhaul.</h2>
      <img src="https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Deku-vs-Overhaul-Cropped-1.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5">
      <br>
      Overhaul was the main antagonist of the Shie Hassaikai arc of the series where he stood as a <br> massive thorn in the side of both the Heroes and the Villains.
      <br><br>
      He eventually fell at the hands of Midoriya who, using Eri's help, managed to unleash 100% of <br> his Quirk. Using his maximum powers, Midoriya was able to overwhelm Overhaul in an epic<br> battle that blew the fans away.
      <br><br><br><br><br>
      
      <h2><span>7</span>/10.<br>Shigaraki Vs Re-Destro.</h2>
      <br><br>
      <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Re-Destro-Cropped.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5">
      <br>
      Shigaraki Tomura and his League of Villains went head-to-head against the Meta Liberation <br> Army, led by none other than Rikiya Yotsubashi, better known as Re-Destro.
      <br><br><br>
      Although Shigaraki was completely outclassed in the majority of the fight, he went on to dive <br> into his deepest of past memories which allowed him to awaken his Quirk powers. Once <br> awakened, Shigaraki was able to end the fight with the powers of the Decay Quirk within <br> minutes.
      <br><br><br><br><br>
        
      <h2><span>6</span>/10.<br>Mirko Vs High-Ends
        <br><br>
        <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Mirko-Arm.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5">
        <br>
        Mirko, the Number 5 Hero, recently took the spotlight in the ongoing arc of My Hero <br> Academia where the Heroes attacked Shigaraki Tomura and his Meta Liberation Army's base <br> of operation.
      <br><br>
        Surrounded by multiple High-End Nomus, Mirko, instead of retreating, fought all of them <br> head-on in an incredible battle where she even sacrificed her limbs for the sake of stopping <br> Shigaraki. Although short, this fight was filled with action to the brim, which is why the fans <br> love it.
        <br><br><br><br><br>
          
        <h2><span>5</span>/10.<br>Izuku Midoriya Vs Shoto Todoroki.
          <br><br>
        <img src="https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Shoto-Todoroki-My-Hero-Academia.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5">
            <br>
            During the Sports Festival arc, My Hero Academia delivered yet another staggering fight when Izuku took on Shoto in an incredible match-up.
            <br><br>
            Despite wanting to win, Izuku made sure to help Shoto overcome his past by pushing him to <br> use his fire-side for the first time in a very long time. Relishing the challenge Midoriya posed <br> and accepting his Quirk momentarily, Shoto blasted Midoriya with his full power and ended <br> up winning the fight.
            <br><br><br><br><br>
            
            <h2><span>4</span>/10.<br>Izuku Midoriya Vs Bakugo Katsuki</h2>
            <img src="https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Deku-vs-Bakugo-Cropped.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5">
            <br>
            Midoriya and Bakugo have clashed multiple times throughout the series already and the best <br> of the lot was certainly the one that followed the Kamino incident.
            <br><br>
            Not only did the two go all-out during this fight, but also managed to relate to each other for <br> the very first time. This fight became a turning point in the relationship between the two and <br> while it did end in Bakugo's favor, he also ended up acknowledging Midoriya as a worthy rival.
            <br><br><br><br><br>  
            
            <h2><span>3</span>/10.<br>All Might Vs USJ Nomu</h2>
            <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/All-Might-USJ.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5">
            <br>
            The first display of All Might's true power came during his clash against the USJ Nomu in the <br> very first season of My Hero Academia. The USJ Nomu was created to counter All Might at <br> his 100%, yet the Number One managed to win at the end of the day.
            <br><br>
            Arriving just in time to save his students, All Might went beyond his 100% and hit the Nomu so fast that he didn't even get a chance to regenerate.
            <br><br><br><br><br>
            
            <h2><span>2</span>/10.<br>All For One Vs All Might</h2>
            <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/United-States-of-Smash.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5">
            <br>
            All For One and All Might went head-to-head for the last time in Kamino during the third <br> season of My Hero Academia. Strong as All For One was, he managed to push All Might <br> beyond all his limits and forced him to use his strongest move "United States of Smash" against him.
            <br><br>
            Although All Might did win the fight, it came at the cost of his fall as the Symbol of Peace, <br> since he ended burning the wisps of One For All that were left in his body.
            <br><br><br><br><br>
            
            <h2><span>1</span>/10.<br>Endeavor Vs Hood</h2>
            <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/endeavor-vs-hood-nomu.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5" id="w">
            <br><br><br>
            After the fall of All Might, people were faced with the greatest Nomu threat that they had ever <br> faced in a High-End Nomu named Hood. Even someone as strong as Endeavor proved to be weaker than him.
            <br><br>
            Realizing that All Might was not there to protect them anymore, everyone started to give up <br> when Endeavor stepped up and made the role of "Symbol of Peace" his very own. Just like All Might, <br> he went Plus Ultra and blasted the Nomu with his strongest Prominence Burn, <br> announcing himself as a reliable Number One in the process.
