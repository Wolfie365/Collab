      <img src="https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/My-Hero-Academia-Midoriya-Versus-Gentle-Criminal.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5">
      <br>.
      Izuku Midoriya clashed against Gentle Criminal during the U.A Cultural Festival arc of My <br> Hero Academia. As Gentle finally prepared to announce himself to the world, Midoriya <br> stood in his way and stopped him from accomplishing his goals.
      <br><br><br>
      Although Gentle was quite powerful, Midoriya showed off his growth by reading him like a <br> book and then unleashing the power of Air Force on him. To date, this fight remains to be one <bR> of the best seen in the series.
      <br><br><br><br>
      
      <br><h2><span>9</span>/10.<br>Mirio Togata Vs Overhaul.
      <br><br>
      <img src="https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Mirio-Cropped.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5">
      <br>
      Mirio Togata went firing on all cylinders during the raid on the Shie Hassaikai hideout in My <br> Hero Academia Season 4. His clash against Overhaul was expected and Horikoshi made sure <br> to deliver when it arrived.
      <br><br><br><br><br>
      
      <h2><span>8</span>/10.<br>Izuku Midoriya Vs Overhaul.</h2>
      <img src="https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Deku-vs-Overhaul-Cropped-1.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5">
      <br>
      Overhaul was the main antagonist of the Shie Hassaikai arc of the series where he stood as a <br> massive thorn in the side of both the Heroes and the Villains.
      <br><br>
      He eventually fell at the hands of Midoriya who, using Eri's help, managed to unleash 100% of <br> his Quirk. Using his maximum powers, Midoriya was able to overwhelm Overhaul in an epic<br> battle that blew the fans away.
      <br><br><br><br><br>
      
      <h2><span>7</span>/10.<br>Shigaraki Vs Re-Destro.</h2>
      <br><br>
      <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Re-Destro-Cropped.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5">
      <br>
      Shigaraki Tomura and his League of Villains went head-to-head against the Meta Liberation <br> Army, led by none other than Rikiya Yotsubashi, better known as Re-Destro.
      <br><br><br>
      Although Shigaraki was completely outclassed in the majority of the fight, he went on to dive <br> into his deepest of past memories which allowed him to awaken his Quirk powers. Once <br> awakened, Shigaraki was able to end the fight with the powers of the Decay Quirk within <br> minutes.
      <br><br><br><br><br>
      <h2><span>6</span>/10.<br>Mirko Vs High-Ends
        <br><br>
        <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Mirko-Arm.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5">
        <br>
        Mirko, the Number 5 Hero, recently took the spotlight in the ongoing arc of My Hero <br> Academia where the Heroes attacked Shigaraki Tomura and his Meta Liberation Army's base <br> of operation.
      <br><br>
        Surrounded by multiple High-End Nomus, Mirko, instead of retreating, fought all of them <br> head-on in an incredible battle where she even sacrificed her limbs for the sake of stopping <br> Shigaraki. Although short, this fight was filled with action to the brim, which is why the fans <br> love it.
